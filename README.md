All http://127.0.0.1:5500/ addresses should be changed. This address is related to the location of the vscode live server. To use the local server, the folder address should be written instead, and for the final server, the main server address should be written instead.
This address is mentioned twice in the index.js file, twice in the 748-.js file, and once in the workid.js file.
